abstract="Resource management in a cloud environment is a hard problem, due to: the scale of modern data centers; the heterogeneity of resource types and their interdependencies; the variability and unpredictability of the load; as well as the range of objectives of the different actors in a cloud ecosystem. Consequently, both academia and industry began significant research efforts in this area. In this paper, we survey the recent literature, covering 250+ publications, and highlighting key results. We outline a conceptual framework for cloud resource management and use it to structure the state-of-the-art review. Based on our analysis, we identify five challenges for future investigation. These relate to: providing predictable performance for cloud-hosted applications; achieving global manageability for cloud systems; engineering scalable resource management systems; understanding economic behavior and cloud pricing; and developing solutions for the mobile cloud paradigm.",

abstract="Resource scheduling in cloud is a challenging job and the scheduling of appropriate resources to cloud workloads depends on the QoS requirements of cloud applications. In cloud environment, heterogeneity, uncertainty and dispersion of resources encounters problems of allocation of resources, which cannot be addressed with existing resource allocation policies. Researchers still face troubles to select the efficient and appropriate resource scheduling algorithm for a specific workload from the existing literature of resource scheduling algorithms. This research depicts a broad methodical literature analysis of resource management in the area of cloud in general and cloud resource scheduling in specific. In this survey, standard methodical literature analysis technique is used based on a complete collection of 110 research papers out of large collection of 1206 research papers published in 19 foremost workshops, symposiums and conferences and 11 prominent journals. The current status of resource scheduling in cloud computing is distributed into various categories. Methodical analysis of resource scheduling in cloud computing is presented, resource scheduling algorithms and management, its types and benefits with tools, resource scheduling aspects and resource distribution policies are described. The literature concerning to thirteen types of resource scheduling algorithms has also been stated. Further, eight types of resource distribution policies are described. Methodical analysis of this research work will help researchers to find the important characteristics of resource scheduling algorithms and also will help to select most suitable algorithm for scheduling a specific workload. Future research directions have also been suggested in this research work.",

abstract = "Abstract The cloud phenomenon is quickly becoming an important service in Internet computing. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) in cloud computing is one of the most significant and fastest growing field. In this service model, cloud providers offer resources to users/machines that include computers as virtual machines, raw (block) storage, firewalls, load balancers, and network devices. One of the most pressing issues in cloud computing for IaaS is the resource management. Resource management problems include allocation, provisioning, requirement mapping, adaptation, discovery, brokering, estimation, and modeling. Resource management for IaaS in cloud computing offers following benefits: scalability, quality of service, optimal utility, reduced overheads, improved throughput, reduced latency, specialized environment, cost effectiveness and simplified interface. This paper focuses on some of the important resource management techniques such as resource provisioning, resource allocation, resource mapping and resource adaptation. It brings out an exhaustive survey of such techniques for IaaS in cloud computing, and also put forth the open challenges for further research. "
