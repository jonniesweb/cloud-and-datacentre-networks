### Abstract

Enterprises and organizations are having larger and increasingly dynamic workloads. The technologies that enable the efficient scaling of computing resources is needed to keep up with the requirements of these workloads. The field of cloud and datacentre networking has been evolving to tackle the challenges with building and operating cheap, efficient, and scalable internetworked computing resources. Workloads, such as big data processing, are unfeasible to run on a single server, therefore clusters of computers are needed. This survey covers the main topics of cloud and datacentre networking: cloud services, network structure, software defined networks, data processing, Hadoop, security, and scheduling.

### Info

This project was completed as the final term paper for my Honours Undergraduate degree in Computer Science. *It was also used to teach a Master's level course*  called Cloud and Datacentre Networks (ITEC 5103) at Carleton University.
